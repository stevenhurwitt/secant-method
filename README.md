# secant method

Quick and easy code to run the Secant Method: a numerical method for finding zeroes of a function given two initial values (i.e. an interval in which a zero is known to occur).

Example is given in the code for finding the root of f(x) = sqrt(x) + 3log(x) - 5 over the interval (1,5).
